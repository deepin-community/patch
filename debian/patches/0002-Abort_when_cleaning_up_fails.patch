Subject: Abort when cleaning up fails

When a fatal error triggers during cleanup, another attempt will be made to
clean up, which will likely lead to the same fatal error.  So instead, bail out
when that happens.
src/patch.c (cleanup): Bail out when called recursively.
(main): There is no need to call output_files() before cleanup() as cleanup()
already does that.
